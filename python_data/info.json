As he lay handcuffed and shackled, Pendleton Correctional Facility guards beat the prisoner beyond recognition as terrified bystanders watched from their cells. But Lokmar's story ended differently when 2 fellow prisoners sacrificed their freedom to save him from his assailants, a Ku Klux Klan-affiliated guard gang known as the Sons of Light. The Pendleton 2: They Stood Up tells the story of John \"Balagoon\" Cole and Christopher \"Naeem\" Trotter, the leaders of the Indiana prison uprising that rescued Lokmar, exposed Pendleton's dehumanizing conditions, and unleashed the vindictive wrath of the Indiana Department of Correction. Presented by the Defense Committee to Free the Pendleton 2, this documentary features exclusive first hand testimony from Cole and Trotter, as well as interviews with family members and witnesses to the uprising who continue to fight for the Pendleton 2 after four decades of unjust incarceration and solitary confinement.

That naturally raises the question of whether or not you want to spend eternity with people like that. But it also raises another question: Does wanting the same thing they want make you a bad person, too? During the 2020-2021 academic year, Chiang joined NDIAS as an Artist in Residence as part of the \"Nature of Trust\" project, and has continued his relationship with the Institute. His work has won four Nebula awards and four Hugo awards. His work often focuses on issues in technology, including artificial intelligence. In 2023, Chiang was named one of\u00a0Time Magazine's\u00a0100 most influential people in AI. His critically-acclaimed short stories include \u201cTower of Babylon\u201d and \u201cStory of Your Life,\u201d which was adapted into the science fiction film Arrival.

Ten years later, the United States had been transformed by this stupendous migration, nowhere more than New York: by 1855, roughly a third of all adults living in Manhattan were immigrants who had escaped the hunger in Ireland. These so-called \u201cFamine Irish\u201d were the forebears of four U.S. presidents (including Joe Biden) yet when they arrived in America they were consigned to the lowest-paying jobs and subjected to discrimination and ridicule by their new countrymen. Even today, the popular perception of these immigrants is one of destitution and despair. But when we let the Famine Irish narrate their own stories, they paint a far different picture. \u00a0 In this magisterial work of storytelling and scholarship, acclaimed historian Tyler Anbinder presents for the first time the Famine generation\u2019s individual and collective tales of struggle, perseverance, and triumph. Drawing on newly available records and a ten-year research initiative, Anbinder reclaims the narratives of the refugees who settled in New York City and helped reshape the entire nation. Plentiful Country is a tour de force\u2014a book that rescues the Famine immigrants from the margins of history and restores them to their rightful place at the center of the American story. Tyler Anbinder is an emeritus professor of history at George Washington University, where he taught courses on the history of American immigration and the American Civil War era. He is the author of three award-winning books and of numerous articles, and his publications have been honored with the Avery Craven Prize of the Organization of American Historians, the Mark Lynton History Prize of the Columbia School of Journalism, and the Hubbell Prize of the Society of Civil War Historians. Anbinder has also held the Fulbright Commission\u2019s Thomas Jefferson Distinguished Chair in American History at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and has won three prestigious research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

JEP) is a transitional justice mechanism created as part of the 2016 peace agreement signed between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP) guerrilla group. Colombia\u2019s transitional tribunal was established to investigate, prosecute and sanction those who committed international crimes during the Colombian armed conflict. Its focus has been on achieving truth, justice, reparation, and non-repetition. Likewise, the JEP\u2019s objective is also to contribute to the reintegration of offenders. While the use of restorative justice in the JEP\u2019s cases presents an opportunity to promote a more inclusive and holistic approach to justice, a myriad of questions and challenges also arise, such as: How will the JEP guarantee victims\u2019 rights and their participation in the restorative process? Within the framework of restorative justice, which elements seem crucial for the process of reintegration of offenders to be successful? Which kind of challenges do judges face when they integrate restorative principles in sanctioning war crimes and crimes against humanity? Panelists will offer insight on the challenges faced and advances made, while reflecting on practices that can assist future transitional scenarios. This includes the development of local solutions that transform armed conflict and observe International Law standards. Panelists:\u00a0 Introduction by R.
